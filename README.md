# EcoPower Logistics Project: CRUD RESTful API for Logistics Management

## Overview 11

Welcome to the EcoPower Logistics Project README. This document provides an overview of the project's objectives, the scope of work, and how stakeholders can use the developed CRUD RESTful API for logistics management. The project aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of logistics operations using modern technology and API integration.

## Introduction
The EcoPower Logistics Project focuses on improving the management of logistics operations, especially in the context of delivering solar energy products. This project involves the creation of a CRUD RESTful API that connects to a database to manage logistics data efficiently.

## Project Objectives
### The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Develop a CRUD RESTful API that integrates with a database for logistics data management.
Enhance the efficiency of order processing, tracking, and delivery for solar energy products.
Provide stakeholders with real-time access to order status and tracking information.

## Logistics and Solar Energy
EcoPower Logistics specializes in managing and optimizing the movement of solar energy products from source to destination. This includes careful warehousing, packaging, and transportation to ensure the secure delivery of products such as solar panels, inverters, batteries, and monitoring systems.

## Technology Integration
EcoPower Logistics recognizes the importance of technology in modern logistics. By integrating APIs and utilizing cloud-based services, the company aims to streamline operations and offer a seamless experience to customers. APIs play a crucial role in connecting various components of the logistics ecosystem.

## API Integration
RESTful APIs provide an effective way to transport data between systems, interfaces, and applications. In this project, the EcoPower Logistics Management System will be implemented as a set of RESTful APIs, allowing for efficient interaction with the database and data sources.

## CRUD RESTful API
### The heart of this project is the CRUD RESTful API. It includes the following endpoints:

GET: Retrieve logistics data, including order status and tracking information.
POST: Create new orders and add them to the database.
PATCH: Update order information, such as delivery status.
DELETE: Remove orders or products from the database.

## How to Use This Project
