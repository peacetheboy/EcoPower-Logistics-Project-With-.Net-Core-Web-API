## Overview
Greetings! Thank you for accessing the README for the EcoPower Logistics Project. This document offers a comprehensive outline of the project's goals, the extent of activities involved, and details on the utilization of the .Net Web API designed for streamlining logistics management. The primary objective of this initiative is to optimize the productivity and proficiency of logistics procedures through the integration of contemporary technology and API functionalities. Please continue reading for further information.

## Introduction
The EcoPower Logistics Project centers around enhancing the supervision of logistical activities, particularly for the distribution of solar energy commodities. This initiative encompasses the development of a .Net Core Web API, which interfaces with a database to streamline the handling of logistics information effectively.

## Branching strategies to be used
![image](https://github.com/peacetheboy/CMPG-323-Project-2-36564567/assets/90477030/4ec1cfbf-2d78-4272-8841-1d2753199ecd)

We follow a feature branching strategy to manage code changes effectively. This strategy allows for parallel development while maintaining code quality and minimizing conflicts.

### Branch Types

1. **Main Branch:** The `main` (or `master`) branch holds the stable and deployable code. It should always reflect the production-ready state.

2. **Feature Branches:** For each new feature, bug fix, or enhancement, create a new branch based on `main`. Use descriptive names that reflect the feature or issue being addressed (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/data-validation`).

3. **Pull Requests:** When your feature is ready for review, open a pull request from your feature branch to `main`. This allows for code review, discussion, and testing before merging.

   **Pull request must meet the following criteria:**
- [ ] Code compiles without any errors or warnings
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage is greater than 100%


## Project Objectives
### The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Develop a .Net Core Web API that connects to a database, enabling the streamlined management of logistics data.
Optimize the handling of orders, their monitoring, and the transportation of solar energy items for improved efficiency.
Empower stakeholders with instant access to real-time updates on order progress and tracking details.

## Logistics and Solar Energy
EcoPower Logistics specializes in managing and optimizing the movement of solar energy products from source to destination. This includes careful warehousing, packaging, and transportation to ensure the secure delivery of products such as solar panels, inverters, batteries, and monitoring systems.

## Technology Integration
EcoPower Logistics recognizes the importance of technology in modern logistics. By integrating APIs and utilizing cloud-based services, the company aims to streamline operations and offer a seamless experience to customers. APIs play a crucial role in connecting various components of the logistics ecosystem.

## API Integration
RESTful APIs provide an effective way to transport data between systems, interfaces, and applications. In this project, the EcoPower Logistics Management System will be implemented as a set of RESTful APIs, allowing for efficient interaction with the database and data sources.

## CRUD RESTful API
### The heart of this project is the CRUD RESTful API. It includes the following endpoints:

GET: Retrieve logistics data, including order status and tracking information.
POST: Create new orders and add them to the database.
PATCH: Update order information, such as delivery status.
DELETE: Remove orders or products from the database.

## How to Use This Project
### Stakeholders involved in logistics, solar energy systems, and technology integration can benefit from this project by following these steps:

*Review the README*: Familiarize yourself with the project's goals, objectives, and the role of the CRUD RESTful API.
*Understand Logistics Processes*: Gain insights into how logistics and solar energy products are managed and delivered using the EcoPower Logistics approach.
*Explore API Integration*: Understand the significance of API integration and how it improves logistics operations and customer experience.
*Study the CRUD API*: Review the provided CRUD RESTful API endpoints to understand their functionalities for data management.
*Implementation*: If you're involved in the technical implementation, refer to the API documentation for integrating the provided endpoints with your systems.
